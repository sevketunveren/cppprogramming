Create a Spaceship class suitable for simulation. One of the constructors should allow us to specify the Spaceship’s initial position in 3- dimensional space, its trajectory, its velocity, its rate of acceleration, and its target, which is another Spaceship. The simulation should track a Spaceship’s movement every clock tick (e.g., every second), printing such relevant data as the Spaceship’s identity, its trajectory, and so forth. If you have access to a graphics package such as UNIX curses or Borland C ++ Graphics, you can add graphics to the simulation.
